# Crowdfunding Campaign Data Analysis

## Objective

### The goal of this project was to analyze the provided crowdfunding campaign data by preparing, cleaning, merging multiple datasets, and integrating them into a relational database for comprehensive analysis and reporting. The assignment also required creating a database schema and importing cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database.

### Our team worked together to complete the following steps:
1. Loading and inspecting data
2. Cleaning and transforming data
3. Integrating data
4. Preparing the final dataset
5. Exporting the data

### To successfully achieve our final dataset we were required to address the following: 
1. Column name mismatches had to be resolved  to ensure consistent formatting across all datasets
2. Missing or invalid data types were converted
3. Multi-dataset merges were aligned for successful integration

### Our team completed the databse creation and import by completing the following:
1. Inspecting and sketching the ERD
2. Databse schema designed for each dataset by using the ERD
3. Database setup by creating a PostgreSQL file
4. Each CSV imported to its corresponding SQL table for verification

## Final Outcome

### The final relational database is now ready for queries and provides a comprehensive structure for further analysis of crowdfunding campaigns.
